# Legion-Client

Legion is a full-stack app that allows users to create and study the lore and history of Legiones Astartes of the Warhammer 40k Universe.  A user must sign-up first to be able to sign-in, once sign-in they'll be able to access the various input areas to create/submit legions, view them, or even grab one legion to study (Mongoose-generated ID), update a legion or even delete them if you wish!

### Planning

1/6-1/7 The first couple of days were spent creating my game plan on how I wanted
to attack this project. Creating my API and front-end.
1/8-1/11 -Really focused on the authentication on the user experience. This part was great,
I felt way more confident this time as my skills grow. Had an issue with Heroku(My have occurred again)
1/12- finalizing what I could of the authentication process. First deploy and presentation. Mixed emotions
on deployment as I was happy with what I was able to accomplish but also wishing to have done more.
1/23-24 - Dedicated the major of time finishing up functionality of my web page. Added minor
styling elements, but again was not able to add as much as I would have liked.

### Unfinished
- Add more aspects of the 40k universe to expand on database
- STYLE!
- Better use of heroku (I am pretty sure I repeated the same mistake and may need to clear
  my database. Sorry Chris :( ))
